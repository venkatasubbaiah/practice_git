 Cloud Computing for Agent-Based Urban Transportation Systems
 ************************************************************

Domain: intelligent systems

parallel and distributed computing: inelastic cloud 

=> fixed servers

=> fixed storage 

=>

 
    clients                 mainserver       subservers 

                                                8 :200

    1200                       1200              1600


    2000                       2000              1600
case 1: 1200 :1600:8 subservers:2 servers :resources:wastage

case 2: we are not control the traffic

=>there is no analysis

=>there is no decision support system 

=>it is not possible for increase the number of servers 

=>inelastic cloud: hardware components + software components 

disadvantages:

1. limited number of requests

2. homogenous requests 

3. limited scalability, limited performance 

4. users not satisfied 


parallel and distributed computing + cloud :elastic cloud
**********************************************************

1.cloud computing: on demand network

2. number of requests are increases , number of servers also it is increases

3.database

4.some of the requests generate: count the number of requests or learn the number of requests: estimation of servers creation

 =>changes the number of requests creation :new requests: learn:count : estimation of servers 

=>adaptability :changes the servers design based on the number of requests

=>example: 1000  = 5 

           2000  = 10 
 
5.
    =>in first agent or server: allocate the requests are 1000

=>first agent accept the number of requests are 200 : agent distribution 


6. transport the number of requests: remaining 800 number of requests allocate into another server or agent

  =>mobility : agent transportation        

7. agent transportation process applies till total number of requests allocation

  =>autonomy : framework or organization of different servers or agents 


8. prototype design 

9. decision support system : design 

10.intelligent traffic clouds

advantages
**********

1. unlimited number of requests

2. high scalability 

3. saving the resources: provide the services with low cost 

4. large amount of traffic 

5. dynamic traffic control system

6. multi agent technology 

history of traffic control system:
**********************************

1. IBM: main frames :

 detector technology :traffic lights

:computarized system: operations: fixed : fixed time

=>cycle operations 

=>single location

=>centralized model 

=>in any one of the direction : high traffic: delay the more number of vehicles: heavy traffic: accidents 

=>costly 


2. large scale integrated circuits

=>now i have the first server

=>allocate the number of tasks into first server

=>one intersection

=>in two number of locations only we are control the traffic 

=>handle the extra traffic compare to first traffic control system


3. hierachical traffic control system

=>three components 

=>organizer: collection of requests from different number of locations

=>coordinator: divide the number of requests and allocate the requests in coordinator

=>coordinator requests information store into executor

=>3 layers or 3 levels

=>exchanges the resources: high 

4. parallel and distributed

=>case 1: wastage

  case 2: limited traffic 

5. cloud computing: improve the performance mechanism

characterstics:

1. cloud computing: infrastructure : heterogenous 

2. two transportation systems:actual transportation system ( static agents ) +artificial transportation system (dynamic agents) 

3. two transportation systems are interacted 

advantages:

1. enhance the performance

2. minimize the hardware components

 
architecture:
*************

=> 4 modules description

1. agent training and testing module

2. agent generation and storage module

3. agent deployment and support module

4. ATS (traffic strategies ) : organization layer 

agent training and testing module:
**********************************

=>traffic data , traffic scenes

=>traffic data and traffic scenes allocate into agent or server 

=>before generate the traffic how many number of requests are possible to execute in single server or single agent 

example: 1000 requests: allocate into agent:1000: 250 :251:traffic : agent performance 

=>agent performance information forward to traffic strategy developers 

agent generation and storage module:
************************************

=>check the traffic strategy database 

=>count the number of requests into traffic strategy database

=>based on count using agent performance generate the agents 

=>sufficient agents of information in implementation 

agent deployment and support module:
************************************

=>agent performance :allocation of tasks or jobs or requests 

=>in first agent: agent distribution 

=>first it is sufficient: allocate the remaining number of requests into another agent: supporting agents 

=>agent transportation: from one agent to another agent

=>static agents are not handle the traffic

=>we need to require the new agents of information 

ATS:
****

=>we are create the dynamic agents of information 

=>new agents + existing agents(static agents): interaction : optimal solution 


implementation steps :
**********************

=>1. static agents: remaining traffic provides to traffic signal controller

  2. decision: dynamic agents 


step2: organization layer:4 processes

   1.agent oriented decomposition

   2.agent scheduling

   3.agent traffic strategy 

   4.agent management 

step3: traffic strategies: guidence ,control the traffic : traffic management 

step4: any number of requests are generate: saving the traffic strategy database traffic 

step5: increases the traffic ;ATS: new agents : large amount of traffic also we are save 

step6: it is gives the good performance environment

step7: present databases are intelligent databases 

step8: we are uses the two functions of information: agent oriented decomposition, agent scheduling : some number of agents:traffic :remaining traffic: forward to organization layer(traffic managers) 

=>previous agents : new agents:urban transportation system 

=>it is not control the traffic of information 

step9: this new agents: we are create with ATS

step10: improve the control the traffic

step11: faster manner
